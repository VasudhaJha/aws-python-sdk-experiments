# AWS Python SDK Experiments ðŸš€

This repository contains my hands-on experiments and mini-projects using the [AWS SDK for Python (`boto3`)](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html). The goal is to understand AWS services deeply by interacting with them programmatically through Python.

Each folder is a small, focused project that explores one AWS use case or concept.

## Why This Exists

I created this repository to strengthen my AWS and Python automation skills beyond theory. While working on infrastructure with tools like `Terraform`, I realized the power of combining scripting with cloud APIs for automation, orchestration, and DevOps use cases.

This repo is my way of mastering AWS services at a deeper level through real-world scripts and hands-on mini projects.
